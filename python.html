<h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)" target="_blank" title="the definition of 'Python'">python</a></h2><br><strong>Python</strong> is an <u>interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language</u>. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects. <p style=“margin-top:	50px;”><strong>Python</strong> is <u>dynamically-typed</u> and <u>garbage-collected</u>. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. Python is often described as a <strong>"batteries included" language</strong> due to its comprehensive standard library. </p><p><strong>Guido van Rossum</strong> began working on Python in the late 1980s, as a successor to the ABC programming language, and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0. Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new features, such as list comprehensions and a garbage collection system using reference counting. Python 3.0 was released in 2008 and was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible and much Python 2 code does not run unmodified on Python 3. Python 2 was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020.</p><p><strong>Python</strong> consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages.</p>
